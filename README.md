Yelp Business Density

Takes the imputs of a search term and a US State and scrapes all the data from every zip code in that state from Yelp. 
Then caluclates the density of that type of business in that zip code, normalizes the data from most dense as 1 to least dense as zero.  Then generates a heatmap to show where the ratio of people to that business type is the highest.
